> This is a **projection**.

`tiny_universe` is a *public-safe mirror* of a much larger architecture.

What you see here:

- `toy_engine.py` – a single–step decision engine
- `toy_persona.py` – three visible personas:
  - `ToyAlphaPersona` – surface-level stat-arb mimic
  - `ToyConvexityPersona` – toy convex / gamma shadow
  - `ToyGuardianPersona` – risk-shaping ghost
- `toy_router.py` – equal-weight combiner
- `cosmic/wormhole.py` – **WormholeTensor**:
  routes signals through a fake “curvature field”
- `cosmic/quantum_bridge.py` – **QuantumBridge**:
  performs “quantum collapse” (actually simple aggregation)

None of this is the real thing.  
This layer exists so that:

- 🐭 **small animals** can stare at something shiny  
- 🕷 **crawlers** have a sandbox to chew on  
- 🛰 **silent scanners** think they’ve found “the system”

The actual architecture does not live here.
