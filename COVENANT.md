- SovereignRouter™ command-routing semantics
- Battlefield symbolic-structural metaphor
- Sovereignty-before-adaptation risk philosophy
- Naming conventions & conceptual language system

These elements constitute **creative-technical structural expression**
and are protected as conceptual architecture.
