# 🛡 FDE Battlefield Sovereign Architecture™
### Alpha-Centric, Risk-Aware Decision Architecture

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Alpha is the permanent and final decision authority.**  
All other personas function as **auxiliary stabilization and enforcement layers**
operating strictly within Alpha-defined laws, constraints, and boundaries.

This architecture is designed for environments characterized by:

- adversarial pressure
- structural uncertainty and deception
- volatility, regime shifts, and constraint violations

Its purpose is **long-horizon survivability, bounded adaptation, and sovereign control**.
