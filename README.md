# 🛡 FDE Battlefield Sovereign Architecture™
### Alpha-Centric, Risk-Aware Decision Architecture

**Sovereign Creator:** Yinan Yang  
**Architecture Origin:** Alpha-Centric Sovereign Design

---

> A sovereign, alpha-centric decision architecture for adversarial,
> high-uncertainty, and regime-unstable environments.



> **FDE is a sovereign, cross-domain decision architecture — not a single-purpose
financial, engineering, or tactical tool.**
>
> The implementations, metaphors, strategies, and system examples contained in this
repository represent **domain-specific projections** of the architecture,
rather than the architecture’s canonical form itself.

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Alpha is the permanent and final decision authority.**  
All other personas function as **auxiliary stabilization and enforcement layers**
operating strictly within Alpha-defined laws, constraints, and boundaries.

This architecture is designed for environments characterized by:

- adversarial pressure
- structural uncertainty and deception
- volatility, regime shifts, and constraint violations

Its purpose is **long-horizon survivability, bounded adaptation, and sovereign control**.

Branch semantics (engineering & legal notice)

main
The only stable, authoritative, and externally meaningful branch of this repository.
All continuous integration (CI) checks, validations, and representations of the system apply exclusively to main.
Only code merged into main constitutes an operative, reviewable, or licensable form of this work.

dev, experiment, or any other non-main branches
Are strictly internal, provisional, and non-operative.
These branches are used solely for exploratory, intermediate, or discarded work and do not represent releases, roadmaps, disclosures, or commitments of any kind.
Code in these branches has no legal, technical, or commercial standing, may be incomplete or misleading by design, and may be rebased, altered, or deleted at any time without notice.

Legal boundary
For purposes of interpretation under United States copyright law and applicable international copyright treaties,
only the contents of main constitute an intentional publication or disclosure.
