# 🌐 Introduction

`battlefield-fde-agentic-ai-service` is a **battlefield-grade adversarial robustness and model stability framework**, designed for environments with extreme noise, perturbation, adversarial pressure, and high-intensity gradient distortions.

This system is not a toy adversarial sandbox —  
it is a **structural stress-testing engine** for AI models.

Core components:

- **U-Net Generator** — structural restoration under noise  
- **PatchGAN Discriminator** — authenticity scoring under adversarial uncertainty  
- **FDE Classifier (Feature Deviation Engine)** — stabilizes logits, resists collapse  
- **FGSM / PGD-100 / Gradient-Climbing Attacks** — multi-tier adversarial pressure  
- **Loss Surface Explorer** — understanding geometric vulnerabilities and curvature behavior  

This framework is designed for:

- adversarial research  
- model reliability under extreme conditions  
- safety testing  
- agentic intelligence structural analysis  
- robustness benchmarking
