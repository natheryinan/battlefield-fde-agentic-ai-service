> **FDE 是一套主权式跨领域存在结构（Sovereign Architecture），而不仅是金融或工程工具。**

## 🎯 Principle

**Alpha is the permanent and final sovereign decision authority.**  
All other personas operate as **auxiliary stability instruments**
under Alpha-defined laws and boundaries.

This system is designed for:

- adversarial environments
- structural deception
- volatility and regime instability

Its purpose is **endurance, survival, and disciplined sovereignty**.
