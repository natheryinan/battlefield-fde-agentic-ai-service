# FDE Experiments — What Are We Testing?

FDE experiments do NOT optimize returns.

They validate:
1. Canonicalization correctness
2. Normalization stability
3. Regime routing determinism
4. Governance enforcement (Guardian + Alpha)

An experiment is considered successful
even if returns are zero,
as long as sovereignty is preserved.


Each experiment YAML represents:
- a closed world
- a fixed governance structure
- a legally bounded execution scope
