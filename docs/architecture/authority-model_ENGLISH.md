## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines and establishes the **Authority Model**
governing the FDE Battlefield Sovereign Architecture™.

It specifies:

- Who holds decision authority  
- How authority is delegated  
- Under what conditions authority is valid  
- When decisions are binding, invalid, or treated as non-existent  

This document is **canonical**.  
Any interpretation, implementation, experiment, or derivative work
that contradicts this model is considered **invalid**.

## 2. Definition of Authority

In FDE, **authority** is defined as:

> The exclusive and final right to make a decision

Authority is **not**:

- Consensus  
- Voting  
- Averaging  
- Majority agreement  
- Emergent behavior  

Authority must be **explicit**, not inferred,
statistical, or post-hoc interpreted.

## 3. Sovereign Authority (Alpha)

**Alpha** is the sole sovereign authority

Alpha authority is:

of advisory inputs,
**all final decisions resolve to Alpha**.

Alpha may consult.  
Alpha may delegate execution.  
Alpha does **not** delegate final authority.

All personas, modules, and subsystems
other than Alpha
operate solely under **delegated authority**.

Delegated authority is:

- Conditional  
- Scope-limited  
- Revocable  
- Valid only while compliant wi
