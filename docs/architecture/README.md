# FDE Architecture Overview

This document outlines the canonical structure of the
FDE Battlefield Sovereign Architecture™, including its
decision authority model, constraint layers, and domain projections.

This directory defines the **architecture itself**,
independent of any specific implementation.

## 1. Canonical Authority Model
- Alpha — Final decision authority
- Guardian — Boundary enforcement and risk containment
- Covenant — Law, constraints, and non-violation doctrine

## 2. Canonicalization Rules
- Criteria for valid implementations and experiments
- Conditions under which an implementation is considered non-canonical

## 3. Projection Domains
- Governance and institutional systems
- Strategic and adversarial environments
- Psychological and behavioral systems
- Engineering and complex technical systems

## 4. Evolution and Extension
- How new projection domains may be introduced
- What elements of the architecture are immutable
